# Day 55 - Web Dev Journey

Started a new project today: Chef Claude (from Bob Ziroll’s React course).

This is my first dynamic website and the craziest part is — I’m actually understanding everything!

### What I did:
- Set up the project
- Worked with dynamic data
- Used props to pass data between components
- Rendering components using `.map()`

React is finally starting to make sense. Let’s go!
