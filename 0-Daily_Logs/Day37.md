## 📘 What I Did Today

🚀 **Big milestone day!**

- ✅ Built (almost completely) a **JWT authentication server** from scratch:
  - User registration & login routes
  - Password hashing with `bcryptjs`
  - JWT generation and verification using `jsonwebtoken`
  - Protected routes with middleware
  - Stored users in MongoDB

- 🛠️ Started a **new Bookstore App** using everything learned so far:
  - Node.js + Express backend
  - MongoDB for data
  - Organized modular structure
  - Already has auth & basic book routes in place

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- JWT is the industry standard for secure user auth
- Middleware can cleanly protect routes
- Building real apps is the fastest way to *truly* learn

## 🔁 What’s Next?

➡️ Complete full CRUD for the Bookstore (Books, Users)  
➡️ Add role-based access if time permits  
➡️ Start thinking about frontend for this (maybe with React later)

📌 Finally building real stuff from scratch — this is where it gets real 🔥
