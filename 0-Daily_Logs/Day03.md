## ðŸ“… 14 April 2025 â€” Day 45 of dev-learning-journey

### âœ… What I Did Today
- Revisited the **TextUtils** React project
- Added a new feature: **Dark Mode Toggle**
  - Implemented a button that switches the theme between **light** and **dark**
  - Handled dynamic style changes using **state**
  - Updated components to reflect theme change in real-time

### ðŸ§  Learning Process
- First, followed a tutorial to build the basic version of the project
- Then, rebuilt the entire app **from scratch by myself**
  - Improved structure and styling
  - Made the code cleaner and more readable

### ðŸ’¡ Reflections
- Building the project alone after the tutorial boosted my understanding
- Learned how to control global app state for UI themes
- Getting more confident with React logic and thinking in components
