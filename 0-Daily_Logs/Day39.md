# Day 79 â€“ 20 May 2025

## âœ… Todayâ€™s Progress:
- Started learning **Next.js** â€“ the React framework for production-ready apps.
- Got hands-on with:
  - **File-based routing** (pages as routes)
  - **Dynamic routing** using `[param]`
  - **Loading UI** with `loading.js`
  - **Error handling** using `error.js` and 404 pages

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways:
- Next.js simplifies routing compared to React Router.
- The dynamic routing system feels very intuitive.
- Built-in support for loading and error states is very powerful.
- Excited by how easy it is to create clean, server-rendered pages.

## ðŸš€ Next Steps:
- Spend the next 2 days diving deeper into:
  - API routes
  - Server-side rendering (SSR) vs static generation (SSG)
  - Deploying a small Next.js app
- Will start building a small real-world project using these features.
