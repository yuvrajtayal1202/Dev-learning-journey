# Day 81 - Deep Dive into Next.js Core Features ðŸ§ 

## What I Learned:
- Dynamic routes and catch-all routes
- Data fetching methods:
  - `getStaticProps`
  - `getServerSideProps`
  - `getStaticPaths`
- API routes in Next.js

## Key Concepts:
- Pre-rendering and performance benefits
- Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
- Building basic APIs inside `pages/api`
- Dynamic routing with parameters

## Reflections:
Learning about data fetching in Next.js was a big upgrade. It makes fullstack development way smoother compared to traditional React + Express setups.
