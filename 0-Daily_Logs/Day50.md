# Day 51 â€“ 31 May 2025

### ðŸ“‰ What happened:
- Started learning **Matplotlib** for data visualization in Python.
- Struggled to understand most of it â€” couldn't follow along clearly.
- Didnâ€™t make any progress on fullstack or the ongoing Next.js apps.

---

### ðŸ§  Reflection:
Not every day will be productive â€” and thatâ€™s okay.

The key is to:
- **Log it** (done âœ…)
- **Reset with intention**
- Show up again tomorrow.

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Tomorrowâ€™s goal:
- Revisit the Matplotlib basics with a fresh mind.
- Try to get back to fullstack work or continue the current Next.js app.
