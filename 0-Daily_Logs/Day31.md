## 📘 What I Learned Today

Started learning **Node.js** from:

- 🔹 [FreeCodeCamp Node.js Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oe421EPjeBE) by John Smilga

### Topics Covered:
- What is Node.js and why it's useful
- Running JS outside the browser (V8 engine)
- `global` object and built-in modules like `path`, `fs`, `os`
- `require`, `module`, and creating custom modules
- `setInterval`, `setTimeout`
- First Node.js script 🚀

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Node.js isn't a framework — it's a runtime environment.
- It uses the same JavaScript language, but with access to system-level APIs (like files, OS info).
- You can modularize your code using `module.exports` and `require`.
