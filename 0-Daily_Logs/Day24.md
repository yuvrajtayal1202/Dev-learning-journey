# Day 24 - Web Dev Journey (6 May 2025)

## 🌐 Focus: Introduction to React Router

Today I started learning React Router, a core part of making React apps with multiple pages. I understood why client-side routing is essential and how React Router helps simulate multi-page behavior in SPAs (Single Page Applications).

### ✅ What I Learned:
- Why routing is needed in SPAs
- Introduction to `react-router-dom`
- Difference between traditional navigation vs client-side routing
- How to set up a basic `BrowserRouter`
- Creating basic routes with `<Route>` and `<Routes>`
- Using `<Link>` instead of `<a>` for navigation
- Path-to-component rendering logic

### 🛠️ Code Practice:
- Installed `react-router-dom`
- Set up `BrowserRouter` in `main.jsx`
- Created a basic project with Home, About, and Contact pages
- Used `<Link>` to navigate between pages

### 🚀 Next Up:
- Learn dynamic routing and nested routes
- 404 pages and route fallbacks
- Start applying routing in mini-projects

### 💭 Reflection:
Routing adds a whole new layer of power to React apps. Excited to move from static components to dynamic multi-view applications!
