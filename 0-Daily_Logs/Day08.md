## 📅 Day 50 – April 19, 2025

### ✅ What I Did Today
- Reflected on my React learning progress so far.
- Realized that from Day 5–Day 10 I wasn’t fully understanding core React concepts.
- I was learning from CodeWithHarry’s course, but the pace and structure didn’t fully match my learning style.

### 🔁 What I Changed
- Switched to **Chai aur Code React Course** by Ankur.
- Rewinding a bit to re-learn key concepts from the ground up — this time with more focus and deeper understanding.
- Will restart hands-on practice and rebuild projects again with clarity.

### 🎯 Why This Matters
- I want to be job-ready with deep React knowledge.
- Not chasing speed — chasing real skill.
- Long-term roadmap demands strong fundamentals, not rushed tutorials.

🧠 Lesson: Don’t be afraid to switch gears when something isn’t working. The right resource at the right time can 10x your understanding.
