# Day 70 â€“ Web Dev Journey (11 May)

## âœ… What I did today:
- Finished building and polishing my **Notes App** with full React Router integration.
- Completed the **frontend and full functionality**.
- Finalized the **backend setup** â€“ officially done with frontend + backend basics!

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s next:
- Starting full backend + database journey from **Day 71 to Day 120** (50 days focus).
- Will dive into Node.js, Express, MongoDB, authentication, and more.

## ðŸ§  Reflections:
- Feeling proud of wrapping up the first major phase!
- Learned how to connect frontend and backend meaningfully in a real project.
- Ready to level up with deeper backend and fullstack knowledge.

ðŸ“Œ Stay tuned â€“ backend mastery loadingâ€¦
