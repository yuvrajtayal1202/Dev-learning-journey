# Day 49 – 29 May 2025

### ✅ What I did:
- Completed **NumPy** in one focused day. Learned arrays, vector operations, broadcasting, indexing, etc.
- Tried to start building the **Gym Website** project.

### ⚠️ Realization:
- Building full apps exposed gaps in my backend understanding: **databases**, **auth**, and real-world **API logic**.
- I need more **hands-on fullstack** experience before building complex apps.

### 🔁 Adjusted plan:
- Started practicing by building **Next.js fullstack apps** using YouTube tutorials.

---

### 🧠 Key takeaway:
Learning by building reveals what you *don’t* know — and that’s powerful. Back to the lab with a better focus.
