# Day 80 - Introduction to Next.js ðŸš€

## What I Learned:
- Overview of Next.js and how it differs from CRA (Create React App)
- File-based routing system
- Pages vs. Components
- Basic project structure in Next.js
- Setting up a new Next.js app with `npx create-next-app@latest`

## Key Concepts:
- Pages and Routing
- Static vs. Server-side Rendering (SSR)
- Link component from `next/link`
- Head component from `next/head`

## Reflections:
Next.js feels like the natural evolution of React for production-ready apps. The routing system alone is super clean and intuitive. Excited to dive deeper.
