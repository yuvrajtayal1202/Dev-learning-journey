## ðŸ“… 15 April 2025 â€” Day 46 of dev-learning-journey

### âœ… What I Did Today
- Enhanced the **TextUtils** React app with an **Alert system**
  - Learned how to display alert messages based on user actions
  - Example: When text is converted to uppercase, a message like *"Converted to Uppercase!"* is shown
  - Alerts disappear automatically after a short time using `setTimeout`

### ðŸ§  Key Concepts Learned
- Using **state** to conditionally render UI messages
- Managing **timers** and UI feedback in React
- Improved user experience with real-time feedback

### ðŸ’¡ Reflections
- Felt more comfortable managing multiple state-based interactions
- The app is starting to feel more complete and polished
