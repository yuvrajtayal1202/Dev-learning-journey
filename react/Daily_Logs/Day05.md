## ðŸ“… 16 April 2025 â€” Day 47 of dev-learning-journey

### âœ… What I Did Today
- Learned how to use **React Router**
  - Installed and configured `react-router-dom`
  - Created multiple pages: **Home**, **About**, etc.
  - Used `<BrowserRouter>`, `<Routes>`, and `<Route>` to define navigation
  - Added **Links** for client-side routing without reloading the page

### ðŸ§  Key Concepts Learned
- Setting up basic **SPA (Single Page Application)** structure
- Using **Link** instead of `<a>` to avoid full page reload
- Organizing components for better structure and navigation

### ðŸ’¡ Reflections
- Routing made the app feel more like a real website
- Started understanding how bigger React apps are structured
