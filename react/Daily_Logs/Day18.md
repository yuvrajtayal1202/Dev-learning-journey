# Day 58: April 28, 2025

## âœ… Today's Progress
- Completed the **Meme Generator** project! ðŸŽ‰
- Learned how to handle **APIs in React** using `fetch`.
- Understood **controlled components**: managing form inputs the React way.
- Got a complete grip on the **`useEffect` hook** â€“ how it works, when it runs, and how to manage dependencies and cleanup.

## ðŸ“š Key Takeaways
- Controlled components keep input values in sync with state.
- `useEffect` is crucial for running side effects in React like API calls or subscriptions.
- Knowing how to manage dependencies in `useEffect` prevents unnecessary re-renders or bugs.

## ðŸ”— Next Steps
- Build another small project using multiple APIs.
- Start integrating React Router for multi-page navigation.
