# ðŸ§  Day 07 â€“ 18 April 2025

## ðŸš€ Todayâ€™s Progress  
- Started working on a new project: **News Monkey App**  
- Using **Class-Based Components** in React to understand their structure and lifecycle  
- Implemented the **Fetch API** to retrieve news data from an external source  

## ðŸ“˜ What I Learned  
- How to structure a React component using classes  
- Differences between class-based and functional components  
- Handling API requests using `fetch()` inside a class component  
- Rendering fetched data dynamically  

## ðŸ”œ Next Steps  
- Add routing for different news categories  
- Implement loading spinners and error handling  
- Try converting a class component to a functional one using hooks for practice  

## ðŸ’­ Thoughts  
Learning class-based components gave me a deeper understanding of Reactâ€™s lifecycle methods. Even though most devs use functional components today, this will help me read legacy code and improve my core React skills.
