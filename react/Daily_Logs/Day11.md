# Day 52 â€“ April 21

### ðŸš€ What I did today
- âœ… Finished the **Background Color Changer** project â€“ finally got it working!
- ðŸš§ Started a new project: **Password Generator**
  - Got stuck again with **Tailwind CSS** â€“ still not working, not sure why.
  - Spent time debugging but the issue remains unresolved.

### ðŸ§  Summary
Wrapped up one project, jumped into the next. Tailwind continues to be tricky â€“ tomorrowâ€™s mission: fix it and move forward.
