## ðŸ“Œ Today's Progress:
- Tried following the React course by Chai & Code but found it hard to understand.
- Switched to Bob Zirollâ€™s React tutorial on freeCodeCamp.
- Spent focused time and understood the concepts deeply.
- Built a static website using React.

## ðŸ“– What I Learned:
- JSX syntax and how it gets rendered in the DOM.
- Functional components and how they return JSX.
- How to structure a basic React project.
- The importance of breaking UI into reusable components.

## ðŸš€ Project:
Built a static website using React with multiple functional components.

## ðŸ’­ Thoughts:
Switching the tutorial really helped! Bob Zirollâ€™s explanations made React feel much more approachable. I feel more confident moving forward now.
