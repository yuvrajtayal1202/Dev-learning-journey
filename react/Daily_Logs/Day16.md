**Day 56 - GitHub Learning Log**

**Date:** 26 April 2025

**Today's Progress:**
- Started building the **Chef Clause App**, aiming for a dynamic workflow.
- Learned how **forms** interact with the **server side**.
- Implemented **conditional rendering** based on user inputs and server responses.
- Gained a deeper understanding of dynamic app behavior.

**Thoughts:**
- Server-side form handling was easier to grasp once I broke it down.
- Conditional rendering opens up so many possibilities for user experience!

**Next Steps:**
- Expand the app with more complex form handling.
- Add validation and error handling.
- Connect to a mock or real backend to make the app fully functional.
