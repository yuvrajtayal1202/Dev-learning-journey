# 💤 Day 60 – Web Dev Journey (30 April 2025)

## ⚠️ Just Being Real:

Today didn’t go as planned.

- Barely got in 1 hour of work
- Touched a bit of the Tenzies project but didn’t really move forward
- Had planned to finish the whole tutorial + 3 mini projects

## 🧠 What Happened:
Honestly… just a lazy day. No outside distractions, just me not showing up fully.

## 🎯 Tomorrow:
- Get back into flow
- Finish the Tenzies project
- Reset with intention and clarity
