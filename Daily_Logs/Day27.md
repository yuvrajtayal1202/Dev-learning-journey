# Day 68: Focused Learning – React Router Mastery

📅 Date: May 8, 2025
   
## What I Did:
I’ve been silent for     the past 3 days — not because I stopped, but because I went **deep into React Router**. No distractions, no side projects, just pure focused learning.

## Progress:
- ✅ Learned `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, and `Route`
- ✅ Understood nested routes and layout structure
- ✅ Explored `useParams`, `useNavigate`, and `useLocation`
- ✅ Built multiple route-based mini-layouts for practice
- ✅ Clarified difference between static and dynamic routing

## Reflections:
Sometimes the best way to move fast is to **slow down and go deep**. These 3 days helped me build a rock-solid foundation in React Router. Now I’m ready to apply it in real-world projects.
