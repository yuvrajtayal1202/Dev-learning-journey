# Day 51 â€“ April 20

### ðŸ“š What I explored
- Looked into **Virtual DOM**, **Fiber**, and **Reconciliation** â€“ still not clear, need more time to digest.
- Started learning **Tailwind CSS**, but couldnâ€™t get it working yet â€“ will troubleshoot tomorrow.
- Tried building a **background color changer** project â€“ stuck on the logic part, postponing it for now.

### ðŸ§  Summary
One of those off days. Learned, but didnâ€™t fully understand. Couldnâ€™t build much, but I showed up â€“ that counts.
