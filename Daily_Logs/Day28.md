# Day 68 of Code ðŸš€

## ðŸ“Œ Today's Progress:
- Learned and practiced **React Router** concepts:
  - `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, `Route`
  - Navigation using `Link` and `useNavigate`
  - Route parameters and nested routes
- Understood how to structure pages using routes for real-world apps.

## ðŸ”§ Practiced:
- Created a mini multi-page React app with routing
- Tested route switching, navigation, and dynamic routing

## ðŸ’¡ Realization:
- Routing brings real app feel â€” now React components actually feel like pages!
- Confident enough to use React Router in a real project

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps:
- Starting work on a **personal portfolio website** using React + React Router
- Plan: Responsive design, clean UI, and deployed live with my work
