# Day 72 - 13 May 2025

## ðŸ“Œ Today's Progress:
- Continued learning Node.js as part of my backend journey.
- Diving deeper into core concepts like modules, file system operations, and event handling.
- Researched how TypeScript can be integrated with Node.js for better development experience.

## ðŸ’­ Thoughts:
- Thinking of starting a TypeScript project alongside my Node.js learning for hands-on practice.
- Havenâ€™t started yetâ€”just planning out ideas and goals for it.

## ðŸ”œ Next Steps:
- Continue with Node.js learning.
- Decide on a TypeScript-based side project to build while learning backend.

## ðŸ§  Reflection:
Feeling the momentum building! Backend concepts are getting clearer and I'm excited to apply them in real projects soon.
