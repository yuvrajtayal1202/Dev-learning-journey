# Day 69 – Web Dev Journey (11 May 2025)

## ✅ What I did today:

- Completed the **React Router** course:
  - Learned about nested routes, dynamic params, `<Outlet />`, `<Navigate />`, and route structuring.
  - Built confidence but felt I need hands-on practice before moving to backend.

- 🚀 Started a new React project: **NotesNest**
  - Goal: Solidify core React + React Router concepts.
  - Features planned:
    - Sidebar navigation for note titles
    - Dynamic note viewing via routes
    - Auth & state management (coming soon)
  - ✅ Initial layout done today: sidebar + main view setup

## 🔁 Next Steps:
- Implement routing for individual notes
- Add login and local storage for saved notes
- Continue UI polishing and component structuring
