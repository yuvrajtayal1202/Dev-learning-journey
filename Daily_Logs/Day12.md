# Day 53 - 22 April 2025

## âœ… What I Did
- Completed the **Password Generator** project (was stuck on it for 2 days).
- Followed a tutorial to finally get it working and understand the basics.

## ðŸ“š What I Learned
- Introduction to React hooks:
  - `useRef` â€“ for accessing DOM elements
  - `useCallback` â€“ for memoizing functions
  - `useState` â€“ for managing state
  - `useEffect` â€“ for handling side effects

Even though I didnâ€™t fully grasp everything yet, this gave me a starting point.

## ðŸ”œ Whatâ€™s Next
Starting a new project: **Currency Converter** with *Chai aur Code*.

Letâ€™s go! ðŸš€
