## 📘 What I Did Today

- Continued learning Node.js with [John Smilga’s Node.js Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oe421EPjeBE)
- Completed about 50% of the video
- Explored:
  - `fs` module for file operations
  - `path` and `os` modules in depth
  - `require` and custom modules recap
  - Terminal interaction basics

---

## 🚧 Started a Mini Project

- Began a basic CLI-based Node.js project idea  
- ❌ Paused for now — decided to first strengthen my backend foundation  
- Will revisit this project after learning about HTTP, Express, and databases

---

## 🧠 Key Thoughts

> “Build fast, but learn deep.” — Choosing depth over speed today.  
Solid backend skills will unlock more powerful projects in the future.

---

## 🔁 What’s Next?

➡️ Continue and complete the rest of the crash course  
➡️ Start with `http` module and build a simple server  
➡️ Move to Express.js basics

📌 Backend grind continues!
