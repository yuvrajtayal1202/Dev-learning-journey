### 📅 Day 62 – May 02, 2025

**✅ Completed:**
- Wrapped up the 15+ hour React fundamentals course — now fully understand JSX, state, props, useEffect, and component structure.
- Planned my next 28 days (React Mastery Phase) ending on Day 90:
  - 📌 Day 62–75: React Router + Mini Projects  
  - 📌 Day 75–85: Full original app  
  - 📌 Day 85–90: TypeScript with React

**🚀 Deployment Milestone:**
- Uploaded all previous React + JS projects to Vercel.
- Discovered how to deploy projects using Vercel: fast, simple, and perfect for React-based apps.
- Created a new GitHub repo: [Front-End-Projects](https://github.com/YuvrajTayal1202/Front-End-Projects)
  - Linked each deployed project inside with README + preview

**🧠 Insights:**
- Deployment is not something to “do later”—learning it early helps build confidence and proof-of-work.
- Vercel is ideal for frontend — thinking of diving deeper into:
  - Custom domains
  - Deployment automation
  - Hosting full-stack apps later (Vercel/Render/Netlify)

**💭 Question:**
> I’m considering learning more deployment tools before Day 90. Should I explore things like GitHub Actions, Netlify, or Heroku early on?
